NSFG Background and Impact

The National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) gathers information on pregnancy and births, marriage and cohabitation, infertility, use of contraception, family life, and general and reproductive health. The survey sample is designed to produce national data, not estimates for individual states. The information below provides a brief history of data collection, a summary of available data files, a description of the impact of NSFG, and details about the co-sponsoring agencies of the survey.

Beginning in 1973, NSFG was designed to be nationally representative of ever-married women 15-44 years of age in the civilian, non-institutionalized population of the United States (household population). Later sample changes to NSFG include:

    Interviewing women aged 15-44 regardless of marital experience (1982)
    Interviewing an independent sample of men aged 15-44 (2002)
    Expanding the age range for women and men to 15-49 (2015)

NSFG is conducted through in-person interviewing, with a portion of the more sensitive questions answered privately by self-administration. The 1995 NSFG was the first to be conducted using computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI). The interviews are voluntary and confidential. The response rate for recent data releases was around 69%. Public-use data files and related documentation, including questionnaires, codebooks, and design and operations reports, can be found on the webpage for each release

Human Fertility Collection	https://www.fertilitydata.org/Home/Index

The Human Fertility Collection (HFC) is a collection of age-specific fertility rates for a multitude of populations covering many years. The HFC has been designed to supplement the Human Fertility Database (HFD) and to incorporate data that are valuable for fertility research but do not meet the standards of the HFD. The collection features fertility estimates from diverse data sources, including survey data and data reconstructions. Therefore, users must be cautious about the potential limits of comparability and reliability of HFC data when using them for their research.


Human Fertility Database	https://www.humanfertility.org/Home/Index

The Human Fertility Database (HFD) is the leading scientific data resource on fertility in the developed countries. This open access database provides detailed and high-quality historical and recent data on period and cohort fertility by age of mother and birth order. The HFD is entirely based on official vital statistics and places a great emphasis on rigorous data checking and documentation. The HFD adopts uniform methodology to warrant data comparability across time and between countries. The database follows open data principles.


Human Mortality Database

The Human Mortality Database (HMD) is the world's leading scientific data resource on mortality in developed countries. The HMD provides detailed high-quality harmonized mortality and population estimates to researchers, students, journalists, policy analysts, and others interested in human longevity. The HMD follows open data principles.
