NSFG Background and Impact

The National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) gathers information on pregnancy and births, marriage and cohabitation, infertility, use of contraception, family life, and general and reproductive health. The survey sample is designed to produce national data, not estimates for individual states. The information below provides a brief history of data collection, a summary of available data files, a description of the impact of NSFG, and details about the co-sponsoring agencies of the survey.

Beginning in 1973, NSFG was designed to be nationally representative of ever-married women 15-44 years of age in the civilian, non-institutionalized population of the United States (household population). Later sample changes to NSFG include:

    Interviewing women aged 15-44 regardless of marital experience (1982)
    Interviewing an independent sample of men aged 15-44 (2002)
    Expanding the age range for women and men to 15-49 (2015)

NSFG is conducted through in-person interviewing, with a portion of the more sensitive questions answered privately by self-administration. The 1995 NSFG was the first to be conducted using computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI). The interviews are voluntary and confidential. The response rate for recent data releases was around 69%. Public-use data files and related documentation, including questionnaires, codebooks, and design and operations reports, can be found on the webpage for each release

Human Fertility Collection	https://www.fertilitydata.org/Home/Index

The Human Fertility Collection (HFC) is a collection of age-specific fertility rates for a multitude of populations covering many years. The HFC has been designed to supplement the Human Fertility Database (HFD) and to incorporate data that are valuable for fertility research but do not meet the standards of the HFD. The collection features fertility estimates from diverse data sources, including survey data and data reconstructions. Therefore, users must be cautious about the potential limits of comparability and reliability of HFC data when using them for their research.


Human Fertility Database	https://www.humanfertility.org/Home/Index

The Human Fertility Database (HFD) is the leading scientific data resource on fertility in the developed countries. This open access database provides detailed and high-quality historical and recent data on period and cohort fertility by age of mother and birth order. The HFD is entirely based on official vital statistics and places a great emphasis on rigorous data checking and documentation. The HFD adopts uniform methodology to warrant data comparability across time and between countries. The database follows open data principles.


Human Mortality Database

The Human Mortality Database (HMD) is the world's leading scientific data resource on mortality in developed countries. The HMD provides detailed high-quality harmonized mortality and population estimates to researchers, students, journalists, policy analysts, and others interested in human longevity. The HMD follows open data principles.

"Data Collection
The presented data was originally collected for studies on how overweight and obesity relate to the male reproductive function. Participants in the study were males aged 18 years or older and were recruited between 2008 and 2013 from the normal population through advertisements in newspapers and weight loss programs, and patients from obesity and fertility clinics. Further details on the recruitment have been described previously by Andersen et al. The study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics, South East, Norway, and all participants provided written informed consent. The project was closed in December of 2017, and all data was anonymized. Participants in the study provided semen samples, and standard semen analysis was performed according to WHO recommendation, including assessment of sperm motility, sperm concentration and total sperm count, ejaculate volume, sperm morphology, and sperm vitality. For video recording for sperm motility, a sample was placed on a heated microscope stage (37 degrees C) and examined under 400 times magnification using an Olympus CX31 microscope. Videos were captured by a microscope-mounted camera (specifically a UEye UI-2210C made by IDS Imaging Development Systems in Germany) and saved as an AVI file. Motility analysis was performed based on the videos. Fatty acids from spermatozoa and serum phospholipids were extracted from the samples and analyzed by gas chromatography. Sex hormones were measured in blood samples. Additionally, AMH was measured in seminal plasma. For the association studies, multiple linear regression and partial correlation were used for statistical analyses, with SPSS Statistics 20 as the analysis tool.

Dataset Details
VISEM contains data from 85 male participants aged 18 years or older. For each of the participants, parameters from a standard semen analysis, a video of live spermatozoa, sperm fatty acid profile, the fatty acid composition of phospholipids of serum, demographic data, and WHO analysis data are available. For some participants, two video files were made since there was a drift in the first sample recorded. This makes it difficult for the laboratory personnel to assess the motility. We decided to only include one video per participant due to dataset size concerns. The dataset contains over 35 gigabytes of videos, with each video lasting between two to seven minutes. The resolution of the videos is $640 \times 480$, and the frame-rate is 50 frames per second. The dataset contains in total six CSV-files (five for data and one for the video to participant ID mapping), a description file, and a video folder, Each of the video files are named with an ID, the date of video capture, and a small optional description. Then, the end of the filename contains the code of the person who assessed the video using the WHO standard. Further, VISEM contains five CSV-files for each of the other data provided, a CSV-file with the IDs linked to each of their video, and a text file containing descriptions of some of the columns of the CSV-files. One row in each CSV-file represents a participant.
