Capstone Prep M3 week_1
Over the next five weeks, we’ll be focusing on SQL and Tableau. The workload for this module is intentionally lighter to give you time to begin preparing for your capstone project.

When looking for data for your capstone, keep the following in mind:
Choose a topic you’re genuinely interested in, it’ll make the process more engaging and meaningful.
Look for multiple datasets related to your chosen topic.
You’ll need at least two datasets.
These datasets should be related in a way that allows you to join them together, either by a shared key or a logical connection.
We will learn more about joins in week 2!
