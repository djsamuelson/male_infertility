#Code You Capstone Project INFO

When looking for data for your capstone, keep the following in mind:
	Choose a topic you’re genuinely interested in, it’ll make the process more engaging and meaningful.
	Look for multiple datasets related to your chosen topic.
	You’ll need at least two datasets.
	These datasets should be related in a way that allows you to join them together, either by a shared key or a logical connection.
	We will learn more about joins in week 2!
